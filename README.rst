A Demo of nodejs http2 duplex communication
===========================================

Duplex streams are streams that implement both the Readable and Writable interfaces.


In two terminals run:

.. code:: bash

   npm install
   npm run server
   npm run client

Type stdin messages in the server terminal and see them echoed back in the client terminal and vice vera.
